## Working

By default when the page is loaded, a prompt is loaded. The user can interact with the prompt and gain the necessary information. When the user has a sufficient understanding, they can take the test. There are 6 modules, and accordingly 6 buttons for taking tests. If the user feels like they know sufficiently about a topic, they can directly go to the respective test pages. The answers of the users shall be confirmed by ChatGPT and the corresponding feedback shall be given.
